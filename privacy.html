<h1>What information is collected?</h1>
<p>the only information that i collect for the website is the basic Nginx log file. here's an example:</p>
<pre>0.0.0.0 - - [01/Jan/1970:00:00:00 -0500] "GET / HTTP/2.0" 200 914 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/113.0"</pre>
<p>Nginx will log your IP, time, requested page, and browser. i retain logs for ~60 days. no cookies are kept on my server.</p>
<p>as well, i use Cloudflare to protect some of my websites. they probably undermine everything i say here and collect other information for analytics. however, i never look at their stuff. take a look at <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">their privacy policy</a> for more information.</p>
<br>
<h1>What is this information used for?</h1>
<p>if you're a normal user, literally nothing. i barely look at the logs.</p>
<p>if any attempted abuse on my services is detected, you could be blocked and/or reported to <a href="https://abuseipdb.com">AbuseIPDB</a>.</p>
<br>
<h1>How do I know you won't sell my information?</h1>
<p>you can't. if you don't trust me, there is a <a href="http://floofiestl4hrbxamim2onzjgrehrv4juwv22fyiiguotoahmitnogid.onion/">tor service</a> available for users needing privacy. the onion service bypasses Cloudflare entirely.</p>
