# What is Jekyll?
---
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator built in Ruby. It is incredibly simple to edit and generate a site.

# How does Jekyll change your site?
---
While nothing looks that different visually, it changes a major part of the backend of things. Instead of going through and manually editing each page if there is a mistake or error, I can easily change one thing and it will fix it for each page using a predefined layout.
If you're wondering what the actual code looks like, this whole site is open source on [Github](https://github.com/MsFloofie/Floofie-Site).
