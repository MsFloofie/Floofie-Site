# Why change the whole website?
---
I really didn't like how it was just a static website before. It also looked really bad lol.

# Thatâ€™s cool and all but did you change what you do?
---
Yes and No.
     I normally presented myself as playing video games and editing videos, but I honestly have more that I do than just those two things.
I'm starting to pursue my future in cybersecurity and continuing with being a privacy advocate.
This doesn't mean that I will stop playing games and video editing though.

# What other things do you plan to add to your site?
---
Beyond just a blog that nobody will ever find or care about, I will probably add very poorly explained tutorials for penetration tools I find later down the road. I also plan to add some of my Movie reviews that I add on my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/Floofie/).
Basically anything that I can't fit on my Twitter or things that I find interesting would probably end up on this website.
