# What is Biohacking?
---
Biohacking is a broad term used for people that modify their body. Whether it be injecting a chip or changing your own biology.

# Have you done this to yourself? Why would anyone want to do this?
---
The type of biohacking I did to myself is injecting the [NExT](https://dangerousthings.com/product/next/) into my hand. With this, I will be able to clone/program NFC and RFID tags to my hand. I wouldn't need to carry around extra key cards to open doors as well as public transportation.

# How did you put a chip inside of your hand?
---
Getting it inside the body is very easy, actually. After contacting a professional for help installing it, they simply inject it with a needle between the thumb and index finger.

# Can't this be used for GPS tracking?!?
---
No. It does not have any power source unless close enough.

# Where can I get more answers about this?
---
On the Dangerous Things website, they have a huge [FAQ](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/quick-technology-primer/13320/) which should answer a few questions you or anyone else may have!
