					<hr/>
					<p>I really didn't like how it was just a static website before. It also looked really bad lol.</p>
					<h3 id="thats-cool-and-all-but-did-you-change-what-you-do">Thatâ€™s cool and all but did you change what you do?</h3>
					<hr/>
					<p>Yes and No.
     I normally presented myself as playing video games and editing videos, but I honestly have more that I do than just those two things.</p>
					
					<p>I'm starting to pursue my future in <code class="highlighter-rouge">cybersecurity</code> and continuing with being a <code class="highlighter-rouge">privacy advocate</code>.</p>
					<p>This doesn't mean that I will stop playing games and video editing though.</p>
				
					<h3 id="what-other-things-do-you-plan-to-add-to-your-site">What other things do you plan to add to your site?</h3>
					<hr/>
					<p>Beyond just a blog that nobody will ever find or care about, I will probably add very poorly explained tutorials for penetration tools I find later down the road. I also plan to add some of my Movie reviews that I add on my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/Floofie/">Letterboxd</a>.</p>
					<p>Basically anything that I can't fit on my Twitter or things that I find interesting would probably end up on this website.</p>
