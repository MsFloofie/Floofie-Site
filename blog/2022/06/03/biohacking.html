					<h3 id="what-is-biohacking">What is Biohacking?</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Biohacking is a broad term used for people that modify their body. Whether it be injecting a chip or changing your own biology.</p>
					<h3 id="have-you-done-this-to-yourself">Have you done this to yourself? Why would anyone want to do this?</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The type of biohacking I did to myself is injecting the <a href="https://dangerousthings.com/product/next/">NExT</a> into my hand. With this, I will be able to clone/program NFC and RFID tags to my hand. I wouldn't need to carry around extra key cards to open doors as well as public transportation.</p>
					<h3 id="how-did-you-put-a-chip-inside-of-your-hand">How did you put a chip inside of your hand?</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>Getting it inside the body is very easy, actually. After contacting a professional for help installing it, they simply inject it with a needle between the thumb and index finger.</p>
					<h3 id="cant-this-be-used-for-gps-tracking">Can't this be used for GPS tracking?!?</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>No. It does not have any power source unless close enough.</p>
					<h3 id="more-information">Where can I get more answers about this?</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>On the Dangerous Things website, they have a huge <a href="https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/quick-technology-primer/13320">FAQ</a> which should answer a few questions you or anyone else may have!</p>
